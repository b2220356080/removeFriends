# removeFriends
I had lots of friends in LoL so i had to do this
# To use
First use positionPicker.py and press space to the places you want program to click
Then copy the output and open autoclicker.py enter right pixel values then decide how
many friends you need to get rid of!
# It kinda becomes uncontrollable sometimes
When this happens try to stop the code ctrl c or ctrl f2
# There is no image recognition
Because why would there be ?
